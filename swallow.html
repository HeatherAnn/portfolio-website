    <h1>SWALLOW TATTOO FLASH</h1>
    <p>Inspired by the legendary Sailor Jerry himself, I created these traditional swallows to pay homage to tattooed sailor culture. Sailors would mark themselves with images, such as the swallow, as a sign of nautical manhood. Sailor Jerry worked closely with Japanese tattoo artists to master his craft. He soon created his unique style using vivid colour and a precise techincal application; which we can see in today's traditional tattoo culture. My take on this traditional image is to combine manhood with something soft. Birds in nature are peaceful and often a symbol of love, hence the rose and love letter.</p>
